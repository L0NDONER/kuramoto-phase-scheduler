# Kuramoto Substrate

A self-synchronising oscillator pair used as a timing substrate for a three-tier cerebellar learning stack, a closed-loop thermal regulator, and a phase-space intent signalling layer.

Two Raspberry Pis run repulsive Kuramoto coupling over UDP multicast, converge to anti-phase (φ≈π), and distribute stable timing to downstream consumers via a Mint axis node. No shared clock. No central controller.

## Findings

### 1. DCN eliminates thermal variance

A deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) correction signal was applied to an LMDE host running a controlled 30% CPU load. Ten episodes per regime, matched conditions.

| Regime | temp μ | temp σ² |
|---|---|---|
| DCN=OFF | 48.05°C | 0.051 |
| DCN=ON  | 48.00°C | 0.000 |

Mean is unchanged. Variance is eliminated. The DCN loop does not regulate the mean — it damps pathway surges, producing homeostatic temperature stability. Phase deviation (pd_dev) was indistinguishable between regimes, confirming the correction acts on the thermal pathway, not the oscillator.

### 2. Signal vs actuation separation

The cerebellum sends timing only. It does not inject energy into the actuator. Proved by a null experiment on Pi2 at 30% load: DCN corrections arrived, were received, and produced no thermal effect — because at 30% load there was no actuatable lever. The signal is present; without a plant to act on, nothing moves.

This mirrors the biological distinction between a nerve spike (timing carrier) and the current that stiffens a muscle (energy from the plant). The cerebellum modulates gain. The actuator energy comes from the load itself.

### 3. Stable lock under perturbation

| Condition | Ticks | Locked | mean φ | σ (rad) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pi↔Pi2 baseline | 201 | 100% | 3.1017 | 0.0173 |
| Pi↔Pi2 + Mint (3-node coupled) | 483 | 100% | 3.1114 | 0.0165 |
| Pi2 under 4-core CPU load | 337 | 100% | 2.9236 | 0.0285 |
| Post-stress recovery | 231 | 100% | 3.1023 | 0.0204 |

Lock never broke. 4-core saturation shifted the equilibrium but did not break it. Post-stress mean φ returned to within 0.001 rad of baseline — full self-recovery.

### 5. Complementary homeostasis in a two-neuron system

Two substrate neurons sharing a timing and error substrate reduce thermal variance by 46% relative to uncontrolled baseline. Topology control reduces heat generation; DVFS control accelerates thermal recovery. The two mechanisms are orthogonal and non-redundant, demonstrating complementary homeostatic behaviour in a minimal artificial nervous system.

| Regime | temp μ | temp σ² | peak | cool_s | commits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (no neurons) | 82.8°C | 6.31 | 86.2°C | 403s | — |
| DVFS only | 83.4°C | 5.28 | 85.7°C | 310s | 3 freq steps |
| Topology only | 83.0°C | 3.80 | 86.2°C | 332s | 3 core steps |
| Both neurons | 83.0°C | **3.42** | **85.2°C** | 326s | 2+1 steps |

Topology alone accounts for 40% variance reduction; DVFS alone 16%; together 46%. The residual gain from combining them is modest in variance terms but the mechanisms target different phases: topology suppresses the thermal rise, DVFS shortens the recovery tail. Neither neuron is redundant.

### 4. Temlum: slow integrator on a fast substrate

A thermal error integrator (temlum) running on the Pi2 reader produces stable topology decisions from a noisy control signal:

```
temlum = 0.95·temlum_prev + 0.05·(T − T_target)
e_C    = 1.0·(pred_err − 0.0045) − 0.15·temlum
```

The AxisPulse substrate (~40Hz) paces the temlum update. The cerebellar pred_err arrives at ~1Hz. The actuator only commits a topology change after a 15-second sustained-majority vote. Three timescales — substrate, signal, actuation — are cleanly separated, preventing chatter without losing responsiveness.

### 6. Glyph intent signals — pre-semantic state transitions via phase injection

An intent signal is not a packet. It is a phase-space event: a deformation of the oscillator field that every neuron feels simultaneously, with no routing and no decoding.

The axis node (`reader_glyph.c`) injects a spoofed Pi1 beacon with `θ1 + Δ` during an intent window. Pi2's Kuramoto coupling responds to the perturbed phase. Every downstream consumer sees the real `pd_dev` excursion in AxisPulse — the signal propagates through actual coupling dynamics.

Three intent types, distinguished by amplitude and duration:

| Intent | Δ (rad) | Duration | pd_dev observed | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADVISORY | 0.30 | 1 unit (~100ms) | ~0.30 | Soft bias, readable excursion |
| DIRECTIVE | 0.50 | 3 units (~300ms) | ~0.50 | Sustained push, neurons commit |
| ALARM | 1.00 | 2 ticks (~25ms) | **1.035** | Attractor collapsed, field rings to baseline |

The alarm overshots the π basin entirely — pd_dev exceeded π/3, coherence collapsed, the system re-locked on its own. The shape of the perturbation is the instruction. Neurons respond to the excursion the same way they respond to any phase deviation: no if-else, no decode, no routing. DCN sends error corrections top-down. Glyphs inject intent bottom-up through the oscillator field.

  └──── UDP multicast 239.0.0.1:7400 ────┘
                    ↓
           Mint reader.c  (axis node)
           AxisPulse → 239.0.0.2:7404  (~40Hz, locked=1 when Δφ≈π)
                    ↓
           Mint nazare.py  (transport + staging)
           CortexPulse → LMDE cortex.py   :7410 UDP  (α=0.02, ~50 events)
                       → EC2  cerebellum  :7420 TCP  (α=0.005, ~289 events)
                    ↑
           DCN pred_err_ema ← EC2 cerebellum (reverse SSH tunnel :7421)
                    ↓ UDP relay
           Pi2 pi2_reader.c  (temlum controller)
           intent → 127.0.0.1:7431
                    ↓
           Pi2 pi2_actuator.py  (cgroup cpuset + stress-ng)
```

**Timescale separation:**
- Substrate tick: 25ms (40Hz AxisPulse)
- Cerebellar observation: ~1Hz (every 20 events)
- Topology commit: 15s minimum dwell

**Signal flow — read-only boundary:**
Cerebellum is a pure observer. It sends `pred_err_ema` (raw prediction error) — no correction, no setpoint. The pi2_reader owns all control logic. The cerebellum cannot actuate anything directly.

## Reproducing the Pi2 thermal regulator

**Prerequisites:** SSH tunnel up, cerebellum running on EC2, nazare running on Mint.

```bash
# 1. SSH tunnel (Mint)
ssh -fNL 7420:localhost:7420 -R 7421:localhost:7421 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=no aws

# 2. Cerebellum (EC2)
nohup python3 ~/cerebellum_ec2.py > ~/cerebellum.log 2>&1 &

# 3. Nazare (Mint)
nohup python3 -u ~/claude/nazare.py > /tmp/nazare.log 2>&1 &

# 4. Build and deploy reader to Pi2
scp pi2/pi2_reader.c pi2:~
ssh pi2 "gcc -O2 -o ~/pi2_reader ~/pi2_reader.c -lm"

# 5. Start on Pi2
ssh pi2 "sudo sh -c '/home/pi/pi2_reader > /home/pi/pi2_reader.log 2>&1 &'"
ssh pi2 "sudo sh -c 'python3 /home/pi/pi2_actuator.py > /home/pi/pi2_actuator.log 2>&1 &'"
```

**Watch it:**
```bash
ssh pi2 "tail -f /home/pi/pi2_actuator.log"   # topology commits
ssh pi2 "tail -f /home/pi/pi2_reader.log"      # e_C + intent per DCN tick
```

**Tunnel keep-alive note:** the SSH tunnel drops silently. If the reader log goes quiet, restart the tunnel and kill/restart cerebellum so it reconnects.

## Build

```bash
make          # builds all C binaries
make beacon   # individual target
```

Cross-compiled ARM binaries (`reader_arm`, `phase_sched_arm`, `wan_receiver_arm`) are built separately for deployment to Pi.
